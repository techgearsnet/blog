Androrat
Not to be confused with the alternative Android app marketplace of the same name, DroidBox is one of the most in-depth app analytics tools around, burrowing deep into things like read/write operations, hashes, detailed network data, and security details like circumvented permissions and information leaks.
The default app screen displays a graph that visualizes your chosen app’s behavior, letting you keep an eye out for any spikes or other anomalies. If an app is showing compromised security or hacky activity, the DroidBox is the one to detect it. It canGiven the more in-depth nature of its operations than other apps, the process to getting it running is a little more complicated than other hacking apps and even <a href="https://homesforhackers.com/androrat-download/">androrat</a>.
NetHunter
Originally designed to work only with Google Nexus devices, the popular hacking and penetration-testing Kali Nethunter can actually be used on more recent devices with a bit of tweaking.
Kali Nethunter essentially installs an OS overlay on your Android device, turning your device into a pentesting tool at relatively low memory usage. Using Nethunter, you can crack WEP keys and WPA keys, and detect open ports on other devices as well.It also allows Wi-Fi frame injection, keyboard-hijacking and man-in-the-middle attacks, making it great for testing a wide variety of hacking methods.
Hackode
Though not as powerful as zANTI or cSploit, Hackode is a pretty good app that lets you gather information about other devices. Using Hackode, you can scan and find device or network vulnerabilities.
Along with that, the app also has built-in networking tools like Ping, DNS Lookup, traceroute, DNS diagnosis, exploit monitoring, and security feed. Since the app doesn’t need a rooted Android device, if you don’t mind the app’s cheesy user interface, do give Hackode a try. It gets the job done if you only have basic needs.
tPacket Capture
As you can tell from the name itself, tPacketCapture is a simple app to capture packets and data transferred over your network.
Since tPacketCapture works by creating its own local VPN, it works equally on both rooted and non-rooted devices. The good thing about the tPacketCapture app is that it stores all the captured data in a PCAP file so that you can use powerful desktop tools like Wireshark for detailed analysis.
NetworkMapper
Network Mapper is a powerful tool that makes use of the widely-used Nmap scanner in the background to map and scan the connected networks. Once you install the Network Mapper app from Play Store, it will automatically download and install the required Nmap binaries from the Internet and provide you with an easy-to-use GUI to perform scans.
Using Network Mapper, you can do a comprehensive scan on the network to identify live hosts and gather a range of information like open ports, network attributes, OS information, etc.
Network Mapper works on both rooted and non-rooted devices. However, on non-rooted devices the functionality is limited due to Android restrictions.
